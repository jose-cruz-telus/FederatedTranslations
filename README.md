# TypeScript Project References Example

This example demos a basic host/remote application with TypeScript using [Project References](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html).
On top of this, a translations layer has been added, as a stand alone MFE wich exports the configuration for all MFEs and a Text component which maps the keys to the texts based on the selected Translation configuration.


# Running Demo

Run `yarn start`. This will build and serve all `app1` and `app2`, app3 on ports 3001, 3002, 3004 respectively. And the Translations MFE 3003.

- [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/)
- [localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002/)
- [localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003/)
- [localhost:3004](http://localhost:3004/)
